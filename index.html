    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/EF0601/Logic-gate-lab/releases">View all updates and better update logs. The below provides a simple summary.</a>
    <h3>Version 0.2.1-beta</h3>
    <p><i>1/2/2025</i> Initial release. This version brings along the most basic logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, and
        NOT. It also introduces binary values. It brings a simple connection tool and allows for interactions with
        switches and lamps. The menu, shown here, was also created.</p>
    <h3>Version 0.3.0-beta</h3>
    <p><i>1/2/2025</i> This update brings comment blocks, menu upgrades, and a trash can. It also brings QOL updates, such as table row highlights on hover, and a bottom bar that tells you the input clicked and the hovered object. Also, connections are now updated every 500ms to remove bugs related to syncing.</p>
    <h3>Version 0.4.0-beta</h3>
    <p><i>1/3/2025</i> This update adds deleting connections as a functionality. No more errors related to a connection will be thrown if a deleted element was involved in that connection (connection automatically deleted.) The lamp part was also introduced, lighting up if inputted 1 and turning off if inputted 0. The push button was also added which is similar to the switch but needs constant user input to stay on.</p>
